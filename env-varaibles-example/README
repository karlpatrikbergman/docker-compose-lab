Test docker-compose environment variables

1. Added .env file with default values, and a placeholder for variable
   substitution in docker-compose.yml

2. Verify default values by running
      docker-compose config

3. The env_file feature does not seem to work the way I expected.
   Values specified in web-variables.env is not used for variable substitution.
   They are added to the environment though, as seen when running
      docker-compose config
